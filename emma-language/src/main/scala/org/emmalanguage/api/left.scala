 * Left outer join syntax.
 *
 * A left join between `xs: DataBag[X]` and `ys: DataBag[Y]` where
 * `x.a` is equal to `y.b` can be written in a for-comprehension as follows.
 *
 * {{{
 * val zs: DataBag[(X, Option[Y])] = for {
 *   x <- xs
 *   y <- left join ys on (x.a == _.b)
 * } yield (x, y)
 * }}}
 *
 * The binding `y: Option[Y]` is
 *
 * - `None`    iff the outer `x` has no matching `y` in `ys`,
 * - `Some(v)` for each `v` in `ys` that matches the outer `x`.
